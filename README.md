# Public folder

This folder contains a webo.

Notice the basic structure of a vanilla web site. The crux of the matter is [.data/webbase.json](https://github.com/spintheweb/spinner/blob/master/public/.data/webbase.json), it defines the webo! Sure it's a long read, [Spin the Web Studio](https://github.com/spintheweb/spinner/tree/master/stwStudio) comes to the rescue allowing for easier management.
